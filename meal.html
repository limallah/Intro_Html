        <h3>About Corn</h3>
        <p>
            Semovita is an improved version of corn flour which is a native food  of most notherners in Nigeria.
            Maize, also known as corn, is a cereal grain first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The leafy stalk of the plant produces pollen inflorescences and separate ovuliferous inflorescences called ears that when fertilized yield kernels or seeds, which are fruits. Wikipedia
